# fastpathplanning

 - Precompute library: takes as input the boxes
    - Depends on cvxpy, networkx, scipy, numpy
    - Optional: matplotlib
 - API:
   - Boxes 
   - Use CVXPYgen to pass the problem from the precompute to the runtime as a C library maybe?
   - Make the online performance great
   
   
Action Items:
 - Parth gets Box code working in library
 - Tobia makes sure the paper fully specifies the online algorithm
 - Parth and Tobia implement fast online algorithm
 
2D example:
 - Car driving through safe sets
 - UAV
 - Higher dimension for robots?
